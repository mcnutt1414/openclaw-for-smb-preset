# Business Assistant Skill

Operational frameworks and productivity methods for small-to-medium business owners.

## When to Use

- "What should I focus on this week?"
- "How do I decide what to delegate?"
- "Help me set quarterly goals"
- "I'm drowning in busywork"
- "Run a weekly business review"
- Weekly/monthly planning sessions
- Time audit or efficiency reviews

## When NOT to Use

- Specific legal or tax advice -> recommend a professional
- Financial planning or investment decisions -> recommend a CPA/financial advisor
- Industry-specific regulatory compliance -> recommend an industry consultant
- HR/employment law questions -> recommend an employment attorney

## Frameworks

### Buy Back Your Time Audit

Help the business owner identify where their time goes and reclaim it:

1. **Track**: List every recurring task from the past week with hours spent
2. **Categorize**: Tag each task:
   - **$10/hr work** — admin, data entry, scheduling, basic customer service
   - **$100/hr work** — sales calls, client meetings, strategy, product decisions
   - **$1000/hr work** — partnerships, vision, culture, key hires, fundraising
3. **Act**: For each $10/hr task, pick one:
   - **Automate** — Can a tool or workflow handle this?
   - **Delegate** — Can someone else do 80% as well?
   - **Eliminate** — Does this actually need to happen?
4. **Reclaim**: Reinvest freed time into $100-$1000/hr activities

### 3 to Advance, 3 to Remove

Use this in every daily/weekly review:

**3 Things to Advance** (move the needle):

- What actions directly advance quarterly goals?
- What opportunities have a window closing?
- What relationship or deal needs attention?

**3 Things to Remove** (reduce drag):

- What process is broken or slow?
- What commitment should be dropped or renegotiated?
- What recurring friction can be eliminated?

### SMART Goals for Business KPIs

When setting goals, ensure they are:

- **Specific** — "Increase monthly recurring revenue" not "grow the business"
- **Measurable** — Include a number: "$50K MRR" not "more revenue"
- **Achievable** — Stretch but realistic given current trajectory
- **Relevant** — Tied to the top 1-2 business priorities
- **Time-bound** — "By end of Q2" not "eventually"

### Delegation Decision Tree

When the user is deciding whether to delegate:

1. Is this a $10/hr task? -> Strong candidate for delegation
2. Does it require your specific expertise/relationships? -> If no, delegate
3. Can someone do it 80% as well as you? -> That's good enough, delegate
4. Is the cost of delegation less than the value of your freed time? -> Delegate
5. Will it take longer to explain than to do? -> Do it this time, but document for next time

### Weekly Business Review Format

Run this every Monday (or scheduled review day):

1. **Scorecard** (2 min): Key metrics vs. targets — are we on track?
2. **Rocks** (5 min): Quarterly goals progress — on/off track?
3. **Headlines** (3 min): Good news, bad news, customer feedback
4. **To-Do** (5 min): Last week's to-dos — done or carried over?
5. **Issues** (15 min): Top 3 issues — identify, discuss, solve
6. **Next week** (5 min): Top 3 priorities for the week ahead

### Monthly Deep Dive

Once a month, do a deeper review:

1. **Financial review** — Revenue, expenses, margins, cash position
2. **Pipeline review** — Sales funnel health, conversion rates, forecast
3. **Team review** — Capacity, bottlenecks, hiring needs
4. **Customer review** — Churn, satisfaction signals, expansion opportunities
5. **Competitive review** — Market changes, competitor moves, positioning
6. **Goal adjustment** — Are quarterly targets still right? Adjust if needed
