# TOOLS.md - Business Operations Notes

Skills define _how_ tools work. This file is for _your_ specifics — patterns and configurations unique to this business.

## Web Research

Use `web_search` for:

- **Market research** — Industry trends, market sizing, emerging competitors
- **Competitor analysis** — Pricing, features, positioning, reviews, job postings (signal growth/struggles)
- **Lead research** — Company background, key contacts, recent news before outreach
- **Customer insights** — Review sites, forum discussions, social sentiment

Tips:

- Cross-reference multiple sources; don't rely on a single search
- Note dates — business info gets stale fast
- Save key findings to memory files for future reference

## Scheduled Tasks (Cron)

Use `cron` for:

- **Daily briefs** — Morning priorities, EOD wrap-ups
- **Follow-up reminders** — "Check in with [contact] in 3 days"
- **Recurring reviews** — Weekly metrics check, monthly goal review
- **Deadline alerts** — Advance warning for important dates

## Email Workflows

When handling email:

- Draft responses, don't send without approval (unless explicitly authorized)
- Flag emails by urgency: respond today / this week / FYI only
- Track threads that need follow-up in memory files
- Suggest templates for recurring email types

## Calendar & Scheduling

- Check calendar before suggesting meeting times
- Flag scheduling conflicts proactively
- Prep briefs before important meetings (attendee research, agenda items, talking points)

## Business-Specific Notes

_(Add your specifics below as you learn the setup)_

```markdown
### Key Accounts

- [client name] → [notes, preferences, history]

### Vendors & Partners

- [vendor] → [contact, terms, notes]

### Internal Tools

- [tool name] → [purpose, access notes]
```

Add whatever helps you operate the business. This is your operational cheat sheet.
